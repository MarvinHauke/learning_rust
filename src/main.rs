/* Ownership*/
fn ownership() {
    /* Ownership:
        Ownership is a conecept which builds around the Stack and the Heap.
        While the Stack needs fixed sizes of variables, the heap can handle modifications of varaalble sizes.
        It is also important to know that pointers are always saved on the Stack.
        In Rust a chunk of memory at the Heap can only have one "onwner" (pointer). The compiler checks if ownership was transfered and if so he complains.
        To go around this problem you have to make sure, that only one "owner" is capable of reaching out to the heap allocated memory at anytime.
        You can do so by cloning the memory chunk at the heap, or by returning values from functions and "shadowing" its initial Variable.

        This is what Chat-GPT says about my explanation:
        1. Stack vs. Heap:
            You correctly mention that the Stack requires fixed-size variables, while the Heap can handle dynamic allocations.
            However, it's important to clarify that not all heap-allocated data has a single ownerâ€”some abstractions like Rc<T> allow shared ownership.
            Pointers themselves (e.g., references) are stored on the Stack, but they can point to data on the Heap.

        2. Ownership in Rust:
            A heap-allocated chunk of memory (e.g., a String or Vec<T>) has exactly one owner at a time.
            If ownership is transferred (moved), the original variable can no longer be used, but the compiler does not "complain"â€”it enforces this rule by preventing access to the old variable.
            To allow multiple access patterns, Rust provides borrowing (&T for immutable, &mut T for mutable references), rather than cloning.

        3. Avoiding Move Semantics:
            Cloning (.clone()) creates a new independent copy of the data, which avoids moves but has a performance cost.
            Returning values from functions moves ownership but does not necessarily involve shadowing. Shadowing is when you reassign a variable name to a new value, possibly consuming the old one.

        Suggested Correction:
            "Ownership in Rust is a concept that ensures memory safety without a garbage collector.
        Values stored on the Heap have a single owner at any given time, and ownership can be transferred (moved) to another variable. 
        The compiler enforces these rules to prevent data races and dangling references. 
        To allow multiple accesses, Rust provides borrowing (&T for immutable, &mut T for mutable references). Cloning (.clone()) 
        creates a new independent copy, while shadowing or function returns can also be used to manage ownership."


        Takeaways:
            There are several different versions to refere to a variable.
            - handing over ownership. -> Then you have to take care when the variable goes "out of scope"
            - borrowing or "call by reference", this leaves the ownership at the initial variable or reference -> create as many immutable references as you want
            - borrowing as mutable, but this prefents other references (also immutables!) to that variable. -> prevents data races
